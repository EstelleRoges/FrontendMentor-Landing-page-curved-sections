- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Sass)
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I wanted to do this challenge because i wanted to learn how to add custom dividers. I used the picture tag to add them because it couldn't make it work otherwise...but at least, the result is still satisfying!
I think it also helped me to organize my code better so the responsive coding art is less painful.

### Useful resources

- Simple icons: it's just for the colors associated with the icons. I used them for the social media colors on hover.
